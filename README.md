# Codejam-Loadboard

For Code.jam 2022. 123Loadboard Sponsor Challenge.

Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/smart-trucker

## Inspiration
The 123Loadboard sponsor challenge seemed interesting and useful to industry truckers. I felt that this was something achievable, even if I did not find the most optimal solution.

## What it does
It generates an optimal trip routing for a trucker composed of loads based on available loads from a JSON file. It tries to maximize profit while accounting for gains, deadhead costs, time constraints, travel time, and origin location.

## How I built it
I wrote pseudocode and planned out how to solve the challenge. I researched optimization algorithms. I ended up implementing a greedy algorithm in Java.

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into challenges at every step, including dealing with JSON files, time and dates, optimization, and Github. This was also one of my first hackathons and I have very limited experience.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Completing a challenge and hackathon project alone. The project is functional even though it is not the most optimal solution.

## What I learned
Parsing and writing JSON files, optimization algorithms, annoyances of Java

## What's next for Smart Trucker
I want to try to implement better optimization algorithms to get better results more efficiently. I hope to also implement an AI solution as well as a route visualizer on a maps API.
